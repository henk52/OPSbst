# --delete-after: Receiver deletes after transfer, not before...If some other part of the rsync moved extra files elsewhere, you'd want this instead of --delete-delay, because --delete-delay decides what it's going to delete in the middle of transfer, whereas --delete-after checks the directory for files that should be deleted AFTER everything is finished.

rsync -vaH  --numeric-ids --delete-after /mnt/var/ks/mirrors/rhel/rhel-6Server-x86_64/* /var/ks/mirrors/rhel-6Server-x86_64/
